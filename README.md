# swiftQuiz
Simple quiz app with Gesture Recognizers

In this project I used 2 different Gesture Recognizers:
- Tap Gesture Recognizer
- Pan Gesture Recognizer

## What have I done in this project?

- Create a gesture and add it to a view
- Create controls dynamically by code
- Animate different controls on the screen
- Add shadow to a view 
- Add and remove subviews
- Enable simultaneous gesture recognizer 
- Develop a fully functioning quiz app. 

## How does this app work?
